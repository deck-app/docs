# Viewing project logs

While developing, it’s crucial to view and understand application logs for many reasons, but the most important one is debugging.
**DECK** lets you stream logs right on the app’s output.

- Hover on the Logs button on your project screen. A list of items will show up depending upon the stack you are using.

- Click on the item to flush logs in the output window. The logs will update in real-time for convenience.
