# Accessing project shell

While developing an application with PHP frameworks like Laravel or Symfony, it’s essential to access the shell environment. 

**DECK** lets you log in to the shell and run commands like composer install, update, etc.

- Hover on the Shell button on your project screen to access the shell. A list of items will show up depending upon the stack you are using. 
- Clicking on the item will open up your system’s native terminal, you will be automatically logged-into into the project.
